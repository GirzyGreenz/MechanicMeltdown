Not all objectives are completed.
You interacted with this NPC.
Not all cars are repaired.
Could you repair my vehicle? I will pay you €70 when you are finished.
Maybe I should help my cliënts first.
Hi my name  is Josh. Can I help you?
With this wrench I can repair cars in the Garage.
Hmmm maybe this hammer will be usefull at night.

You already repaired my vehicle.
Thank you for repairing my car, here is your €70.
There is still a car in my Garage. I Should place it on the parking lot before I go to bed.
Let's repair this car in the garage.
If I destroy to many cars people will get suspicious.
I can't use this tool right now.
Fixed, now this car can go back to the parking lot outside.
I can't fix the car here. I should repair it in the garage.
Dr. Carter: Good morning. I understand you're here for the results of your examination. Let's take a look.
David: Yes, I'm very concerned. The symptoms have worsened over the past few months.
Dr. Carter: I understand your concern. We've conducted extensive tests, and I must tell you that the results aren't good.
Dr. Carter: You have advanced-stage cancer.
David: Cancer? That's... that's terrible. How did this happen? What can we do?
Dr. Carter: The cause is attributed to your years of work in a gasoline and diesel car garage.
Dr. Carter: Exposure to exhaust fumes and chemicals can be a risk factor.
Dr. Carter: I understand that this news is overwhelming. We will develop a treatment plan to address the cancer.
Dr. Carter: However, there's an immediate challenge we need to address...
David: What is it?
Dr. Carter: Your insurance wants the full 600 euros of the own risk part for the payment of your treatment upfront.
Dr. Carter: It needs to be paid within the next three days.
Dr. Carter: If you don't have the money by then we can't help you.
David: But I don't have any business at the moment right now. How do they expect me to cough up 600 euros by then.
Dr. Carter: I realize this is a significant amount, but we can't do anything for you.
David: This is a lot to process. I need to leave.
How am I supose to get this money within 3 days time.
How about I wreck some old petrol cars from those rich bastards.
I should do that at night.
Lets get some sleep first.
How are you today?
What a beautifull day isn't it?
To destory this car I should use a hammer from my garage.
